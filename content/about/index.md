Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Rajkiya Engineering College, Azamgarh](http://gecazamgarh.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology (2018-2022). 

I'm currently working as a developer for **Infosys** and my role is Digital Specialist Engineer . My responsibilty includes Java/SpringBoot based microservices development & testing. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
