- Utilized Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Pygame, and Keras to
  develop a real-time system for detecting driver drowsiness and preventing accidents. It uses OpenCV to capture images
  from a webcam, feeds them into a CNN-based deep learning model trained on a self-created dataset, and generates an
  alert when the person's eyes are closed. 
- Key skills used: Python programming, Neural Network
  implementation using Tensorflow and Keras, Deep Learning,. computer vision techniques using OpenCV,
